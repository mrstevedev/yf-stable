                <p>Elastic supply systems work towards the goal of achieving stability. This doesnâ€™t happen instantly, but instead takes time and goes through a continual series of expansions and contractions.  Adopters of YFStable who hold through the tokens expansions and contractions as it searches for stability will continuously gain equity due to contract functions. </p>
