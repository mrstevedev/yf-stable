                <p>Where rebase and seignorage tokens have failed with their fluctuating balances that consistently decrease holder equity, YFStable functions to maintain balance while always increasing holder equity as the token finds its stability in the long-term. By doing this, the need for YFStable in the defi space becomes apparent, serving as both collateral as well as a lendable asset.</p>

                        <h2>Store of Value</h2>
                        <p>By consistently increasing holders equity, YFStable creates a system of increased value storage, even through moments of contraction.</p>

                        <h2>Hedging Against Market Movements</h2>
                        <p>Through YFStables algorithm which provides a stable market, it offers a hedge against extreme market movements for a large number of assets.</p>

                        <h2>A Decentralized Safety Net</h2>
                        <p>Through its system which works to ensure its value doesnâ€™t spike and crash in cycles, its stability becomes a safe haven for users in the defi space.</p>
